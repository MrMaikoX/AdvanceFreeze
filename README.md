# AdvanceFreeze
AdvanceFreeze is a plugin that is required by qLib.


# Why use qLib?
Cause it was requested.

This idea is not my idea. All credit goes to JuceyDrop when he showed me I made it because I was bored. This plugin is unfinish and still needs work. As far as I know here are current issues.

 -> Menu can still close
